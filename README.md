# House-Pricing
# House Pricing Prediction Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. This involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a predictive model to forecast real estate prices accurately. The project aims to help real estate agencies, investors, and buyers estimate house prices, aiding them in making informed decisions.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The entire project is implemented in Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem of libraries for data science and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for running and organizing code, allowing for dynamic code execution and rich visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling the real estate sales dataset. Pandas was used to clean, transform, and aggregate the data.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations, especially for handling array-like data structures efficiently.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization to identify trends, outliers, and relationships between various features.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building machine learning models, including splitting data into training and test sets, applying various algorithms, and evaluating model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: To extract useful features from the dataset that improve the model's predictive power.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques like handling missing data, scaling, and encoding categorical variables were applied to ensure the model's accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score were used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`real-estate-sales-730-days-1.csv`) contains real estate sales data spanning 730 days. The dataset includes features such as:
- Sale price
- Property location
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Date of sale
- Other property characteristics

## Project Structure

- `house-pricing-ds.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for the project, including data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
- `real-estate-sales-730-days-1.csv`: The dataset used for this project, containing real estate sales data for 730 days.
